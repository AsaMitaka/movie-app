# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## How to Use

- Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git.
- Navigate to Project Directory: Move into the project directory using cd your-project-name.
- Install Dependencies: Run npm install to install all the required dependencies.
- Start Development Server: Launch the development server using npm run dev. This will open the project in your default browser and enable HMR for real-time updates during development.
- Build for Production: When ready to deploy, build a production-ready version of the app using npm run build. The optimized files will be available in the dist folder.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured organization to maintain code clarity and scalability:

- src: Contains the main source code of the application.
- components: Houses reusable UI components.
- pages: Includes different pages/routes of the application.
- store: Manages the Redux store and related logic.
- services: Holds services for making API calls or handling external interactions.
- utils: Contains utility functions and helper modules.
- types: Contains TypeScript type definitions for the project.
- styles: Includes SCSS files for styling the application.
